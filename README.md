*   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colours used are black, davys grey and white. Keeping the classic colour scheme simple, yet effective.
        
	![Colour Scheme](readme-docs/coolors.colour.scheme.png)

    -   #### Typography
        -   I opted to use Google's font Lato, due to itâ€™s clean font style, which fitted in with the aesthetic I wanted for the website.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   A strong hero image was used on the home page, to catch the userâ€™s attention. Powerful imagery helps to engage the user and engage them into interaction with the website.

### Future Features

-   Allow users to add items to shopping bag from product page, with an additional button. Instead of clicking through to the product's description page only.
-   Implement Apple pay, Paypal and two-factor authentication.
-   Integrate social media and google sign in functionality, making it more accessible for the user. Additionally allow admin to track user's activity more efficiently. By using data analytics for targeted email marketing and advertising. To encourage business growth.

### Known Bugs

- On small mobile devices, such as the Galaxy Fold. There are issues with the delivery banner, buttons and navbar, wrapping elements and losing their positioning. Creating a more cluttered look to the UX. Given more time, this would be something I would rectify, to keep within the design aesthetic for the rest of the website.

- On small or/and older models of ipads, the home tab link is absent on the collapsed navbar. However it is present on mobile and newer/larger ipad pro devices. Again with more time, this would be another issue I would rectify.

- The sign in check box, to 'remember me' for users on the sign in page, currently does not work as intended. Again with more time, I would resolve this issue, as it would be a useful feature for users to have.

- On the majority of mobile devices, on the shopping bag page, with a product/item in the basket. The quantity tabs, more specifically the 'remove' link (on the right hand side), is obstructed slightly by the scroll back to top button/feature, at the bottom right of the page.

- With the Superuser logged in and on the product management page. If quantities of a product/item are added in to the basket and then said product/item is deleted from the website/database, before deleting it from the user's basket. It throws an error, with a 'not found' page displayed. I have found going in to Chrome DevTools, inspect, application, cookies and deleting the session id, seems to restart and reload the page again. With sufficient time, this issue would be resolved before going live.

## Deployment

### Heroku Deployment with AWS

This project uses **Heroku** for deployment, following these steps:

1. Install these packages to your local environment, since these packages are required to deploy a Django project on Heroku.
- [gnicorn](https://gunicorn.org/): `gnicorn` is Python WSGI(web server gataway interface) server for UNIX.
- [gninx](https://www.nginx.com/): `gninx` is a free, open-source, high-performance HTTP server and reverse proxy, as well as an IMAP/POP3 proxy server.
- [psycopg2-binary](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2-binary/): `psycopg2-binary` is PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python programming language.
- [dj-database-url](https://pypi.org/project/dj-database-url/): `dj-database-url` allows you to utilise the 12factor inspired DATABASE_URL environment variable to configure your Django application.
2. Create a `requirements.txt` file and freeze all the modules with the command `pip3 freeze > requirements.txt` in the terminal.
3. Create a `Procfile` write `web: gunicorn kickz.wsgi:application` in the file.
4. `git add` and `git commit` and `git push` all the changes to the Github repository of this project.
5. Go to Heroku and create a **new app**. Set a name for this app and select the closest region (Europe) and click **Create app**.
6. Go to **Resources** tab in Heroku, then in the **Add-ons** search bar look for **Heorku Postgres**(you can type postgres), select **Hobby Dev â€” Free** and click **Submit Order Form** button to add it to your project.
7. In the heroku dashboard for the application, click on **Setting** > **Reveal Config Vars** and set the values as follows:

| Key | Value |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID | `Your AWS Access Key` |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | `Your AWS Secret Access Key` |
| DATABASE_URL | `Your Postgres Database URL` |
| EMAIL_HOST_PASS | `Your Email Password (generated by Gmail)` |
| EMAIL_HOST_USER | `Your Email Address` |
| SECRET_KEY | `Your Secret Key` |
| STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY | `Your Stripe Public Key` |
| STRIPE_SECRET_KEY | `Your Stripe Secret Key` | 
| STRIPE_WH_SECRET | `Your Stripe WH Key` |
| USE_AWS | `True` |

* I used [MiniWebtool](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/) to generate a Django Secret Key, for this project.

8. Comment out the current database setting in settings.py, and add the code below instead. This is done temporarily to migrate the database on Heroku.
```
  DATABASES = {     
        'default': dj_database_url.parse("<your Postgres database URL here>")     
    }
```
9. Migrate the database models to the Postgres database using the following commands in the terminal:
`python3 manage.py migrate`
10. Load the data fixtures into the Postgres database using the following command:
`python3 manage.py loaddata <fixture_name>`
11. Create a Superuser for the Postgres database by running the following command:
`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
12. Replace the database setting with the code below, so that the right database is used depending on development/deployed environment.
```
if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
    }
else:
    DATABASES = {
        'default': {
            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
            'NAME': os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'db.sqlite3'),
        }
    }
```
13. Disable collect static, so that Heroku won't try to collect static file with: `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1`
14. Add `'kickzzz.herokuapp.com', 'localhost' to `ALLOWED_HOSTS` in settings.py.
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['kickzzz.herokuapp.com', 'localhost']
```
15. In Stripe, add Heroku app URL a new webhook endpoint.
16. Update the settings.py with the new Stripe environment variables and email settings.
17. Commit all the changes to Heroku. Media files are not connected to the app yet but the app should be working on Heroku.

### Amazon Web Service S3
The static files and media files for this deployed site, are hosted in the [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) S3 Bucket. You will need to create S3 bucket, complete the setting up and upload static files and media files to the S3 bucket. You can find [Amazon S3 documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/gsg/CreatingABucket.html) for more information on the setting.
I used CORS configuration below:
```
[
  {
      "AllowedHeaders": [
          "Authorization"
      ],
      "AllowedMethods": [
          "GET"
      ],
      "AllowedOrigins": [
          "*"
      ],
      "ExposeHeaders": []
  }
]
```

- Setting for static/media files in settings.py
1. Install `boto3` and `django-storages` with a command `pip3 install boto3` and `pip3 install django-storages` in your terminal, to connect AWS S3 bucket to Django.
2. Add 'storages' to `INSTALLED_APPS` in settings.py.
3. Add the following in settings.py.
```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    # Cache Control
    AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
        'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
        'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
    }

    # Bucket Config
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'kickzzz'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'eu-west-2'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.getenv('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.getenv('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')
    AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'

    # Static and media files
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
    STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
    DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
    MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'

    # Override static and media URLs in production
    STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
    MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'
```
5. Add [custom_storages.py](https://github.com/anronuay/MS4-kickz/blob/master/custom_storages.py).
6. Delete DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC from Heroku Config Var.
7. Push all the changes to Github/Heroku and all the static files will be uploaded to S3 bucket.
By setting up above, Heroku will run python3 manage.py collectstatic during the build process and look for static and media files.

### Automatic Deploy on Heroku
You can enable automatic deploy in the following steps that pushes update to Heroku every time you push to github.
1. Go to Deploy in Heroku dashboard.
2. At `Automatic deploys`, choose a github repository you want to deploy.
3. Click `Enable Automatic Deploys`.


## Local Deployment
For local deployment, you need to have an IDE (I used Gitpod for this project) and you need to install the following:
- Git, Python3, PIP3
Also, you need to create account in the following services if you don't own yet:
- Stripe, AWS (S3 bucket) and Gmail email.

1. In the IDE you are using, copy and paste the following command into the terminal to clone this repository.
    `git clone https://github.com/anronuay/MS4-kickz.git`
(the other ways to clone a repository are written in this [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository))
2. Set up environment variable in your selected IDE, or you can create `.env` file in your root directory and add `.env` to `.gitignore` file, and add the following to the `.env` file.
```
import os  
os.environ["DEVELOPMENT"] = "True"    
os.environ["SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Secret Key>"
os.environ["STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Public Key>"    
os.environ["STRIPE_SECRET_KEY"] = "<Your Stripe Secret Key>"    
os.environ["STRIPE_WH_SECRET"] = "<Your Stripe WH Secret Key>"    
```
3. Install all the required packages with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
4. Migrate the models to create a database using in your IDE with `python3 manage.py makemigrations` and `python3 manage.py migrate`
5. Load the data fixtures in to the database using the following command:
`python3 manage.py loaddata <fixture_name>`
6. Create a superuser for the Postgres database by running with `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
7. Now you can access the app using the command `python3 manage.py runserver`

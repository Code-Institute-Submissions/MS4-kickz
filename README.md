*   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The three main colours used are black, davys grey and white. Keeping the classic colour scheme simple, yet effective.
        
	![Colour Scheme](static/images/coolors.colour.scheme.png)

    -   #### Typography
        -   I opted to use Google's font Lato, due to itâ€™s clean font style, which fitted in with the aesthetic I wanted for the website.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   A strong hero image was used on the home page, to catch the userâ€™s attention. Powerful imagery helps to engage the user and engage them into interaction with the website.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### User Stories

    1. As a user, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the functionality of the website.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navbar, with the title 'Task Wizard' and the header 'All Tasks'. Underneath there is a small paragraph outlining the intention and various entries from other users with their relevant tasks below.
        2. All Tasks search bar and collapsible task list, when clicked on reveal additional information to the user. Prompting the user to either register or log in to gain additional access to the website.

    2. As a user, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site, to find and engage in content.

        1. The website was designed with the intention to be easy, simple to use and the content to be pretty self explanatory.
        2. Interactively via the task manager application, allowing additional access once user is registered and/or logged in.

    3. As a user, I want to be able to register or/and log in and access personal user profile/accounts relevant to the user. To enable them access to their own specified tasks, with the ability to create, read, update and delete function.

        1. CRUD functionality enabled for all registered/logged in users. Users can only edit and delete their own task entries.
        2. Only Admin user can manage categories section, with CRUD functionality.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPad, iPhone 5SE, iPhone7, iPhone 8, Samsung Galaxy S10 and all mobile device options provided by Google Chrome DevTools.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Manual Testing

Using the Materialize layout and mobile fist development method, it allowed me to create a responsive website. All of the content resizes appropriately within the size of the displayed screen. This was tested using Google Chrome DevTools, allowing me to use the responsive feature and set mobile devices, to resize the screen and see how the website responded to different device screen sizes.

### Known Bugs

- On small mobile devices, Home/All Tasks and Admin Edit Category pages. The buttons seem to stack each other and lose their positioning, this also effects the search tasks box. Creating a more cluttered look to the UX. Given more time, this would be something I would rectify, to keep within the design aesthetic for the rest of the website.

- Currently only one Admin user, has privileges to the Manage Categories section of the website. This can be problematic further down the line, when/if the website requires more maintenance and would need to be reassessed to allow for multiple Admin users to connect.

- MongoDB, storing the Object ID as the primary key for the collection, due to it being a unique identifier. However, within this website/scenario, we have to assume both the Username & Category Name are not changeable and unique. As this can potentially run into errors, due to them being (VARCHAR) string variants.

This project uses **Heroku** for deployment. 

In order to successfully deploy the app, the following steps were taken:

- Visit GitPod workspace.
- Create the Flask App.
- Use the CLI to tell Heroku which applications and dependencies are required to run the application via the, `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` command.
- Create the Procfile via `echo web: python app.py > Procfile`.
- Visit [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
- Click, 'Create a New App'.
- Create an application on Heroku with a unique name **('flask-task-wizard')** to satisfy Heroku requirements.
- Create the Heroku application.
- Add the following configuration vars to Heroku application:
    - `IP`
    - `PORT`
    - `MONGO_URI`
    - `SECRET_KEY`
    - `MONGO_DBNAME`
- Visit workspace/IDE.
- Push newly created `requirements.txt` and `Procfile` to Git.
- Navigate back to Heroku and enable automatic deployment.
- Connect Heroku to deploy from the **master** branch of Task Wizard's repository.
- Successfully deploy the application.

## Local Machine

To run the project from your local machine, follow these steps:

- Make sure git is installed `git --version`.
- If Git isn't already configured, configure Git:
    - `git config --global user.name "your_username"`
